- Open PDF file in Sandbox
- Extract ZIP file directly in Sandbox

### How to install it ?
#### All the steps need to be executed from the Host, not inside the Sandbox

##### Method 1 - PowerShell (Recommended)
-   Right-click on the Windows start menu and select PowerShell or Terminal (Not CMD).
-   Copy and paste the code below and press enter 
`irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joly0/Run-in-Sandbox/master/Install_Run-in-Sandbox.ps1 | iex`  
-   You will see the process being started. You will probably be asked to grant admin rights.
-   That's all.

Note - On older Windows builds you may need to run the below command before,  
`[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol=[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12`

##### Method 2 - Traditional
This method allows you to use the parameters "-NoCheckpoint" to skip creation of a restore point and "-NoSilent" to give a bit more output
- Download the ZIP Run-in-Sandbox project (this is the main prerequiste)
- Extract the ZIP
- The Run-in-Sandbox-master **should contain** at least Add_Structure.ps1  and a Sources folder
- Please **do not download only** Add_Structure.ps1
- The Sources folder **should contain** folder Run_in_Sandbox containing 58 files
- Once you have downloaded the folder structure, **check if files have not be blocked after download**
- Do a right-click on Add_Structure.ps1 and check if needed check Unblocked
- Run Add_Structure.ps1 **with admin rights**
